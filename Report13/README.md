# Instructions
My report is in the file `May3.ipynb`. Please look at that when grading. In this report, I explore [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf), a generalizable multi-modal architecture. I read through the paper to understand its architecture and to learn some more specific information not covered in class. I then explore three different configurations of downstream applications for CLIP.
