# APPM 5720 Reports

This repository contains biweekly reports for the [Applied Deep Learning (APPM 5720)](https://github.com/maziarraissi/Applied-Deep-Learning) class taught by Dr. Maziar Raissi.

The contents of the reports are as follows:  

### Report 1

- Setting up my developer environment with Tensorflow and following Tensorflow tutorials.  

### Report 2

- Finish up Tensorflow tutorials and do exploratory dataset analysis on Imagenet.  

### Report 3

- I explore data augmentation, transfer learning, and overfitting.  

### Report 4

- I explore transfer learning in PyTorch, more data augmentation, and a combination of the two methods.  

### Report 5

- I explore knowledge distillation on both a Multi-Layer Perceptron and on a convolutional neural network.

### Report 6

- I use two different Bayesian Optimization packages in different settings (hyperparameter tuning as well as function minimization).

### Report 7

- I perform exploratory data analysis on the Cityscapes dataset.

### Report 8

- I explore the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset used for NLP models in evaluating semantic relationships.

### Report 9

- I explore the vectors from the GloVe model by utilizing cosine similarity as well as t-SNE.

### Report 10

- I do EDA on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and use a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model.

### Report 11

- For this report I explore Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization.

### Report 12

- For this report I explore and use BERT through the RoBERTa model.

### Report 13

- For this report, I explore the CLIP model through downstream applications.

## Report 14

- For this report, I analyze the effects of generation strategies on GPT2.
