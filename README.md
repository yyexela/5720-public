# APPM 5720 Reports

This repository contains biweekly reports for the [Applied Deep Learning (APPM 5720)](https://github.com/maziarraissi/Applied-Deep-Learning) class taught by Dr. Maziar Raissi.

The contents of the reports are as follows:  

`Report 1`: Setting up my developer environment with Tensorflow and following Tensorflow tutorials.  
`Report 2`: Finish up Tensorflow tutorials and do exploratory dataset analysis on Imagenet.  
`Report 3`: I explore data augmentation, transfer learning, and overfitting.  
`Report 4`: I explore transfer learning in PyTorch, more data augmentation, and a combination of the two methods.
