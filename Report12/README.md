# Instructions
My report is in the file `April5.ipynb`. Please look at that when grading. In this report, I explore BERT through RoBERTa. I pre-train the model using my own hyperparameters to explore the effect of the inverted bottleneck in the model. I also do data pre-processing on SQuAD before attaching a SQuAD head to the BERT model.
